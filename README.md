Tutoring Maze Project
=====================

This project is a reference project for an excercise I will give to a tutor student of mine.
The overall idea is to build a Java Program which finds the shortest way out of a labyrinth.

A detailed description of the exercise can be found in `exercise/exercise.tex` and has to be compiled using LaTeX.
